-- Name: Justin Watts
-- Date: September 22, 2015
-- Course: ITEC 320 Procedural Analysis and Design

-- Purpose: This program processes a set of three softball teams and their runs
--    scored over the course of one or more games of nine innings.
-- Input is a set of three team names followed by the order in which the teams
--    play and the runs scored in each inning respective to the team playing.
-- Each set begins with a positive integer which specifies the number of
--    datasets being processed.
-- Each set is made up of three team names, two lines showing the order in
--    which the teams play represented by the first three characters of each
--    line, and two lines corresponding to the order displayed above showing
--    the total runs scored by the teams playing in those innings.
-- Each dataset ends at the input of "000".
-- Output consists of the total scores of each team playing followed by the
--    name of each respective team. The total runs scored altogether are
--    displayed below.
-- Sample input:
--    1
--    name 1
--    names 2
--    name 3
--    123
--    231
--    0 1 0 2 2 3 1 2 1
--    3 1 2 1 0 0 1 3 2
--    000
-- Corresponding output:
--     7 name 1
--    13 names 2
--     5 name 3
--    25 Total
