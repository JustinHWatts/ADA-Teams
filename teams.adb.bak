-- Purpose: This program processes data sets and organizes them through
--    displaying statistics.
-- Input is a sequence of positive integers organized into sets until
--    end of file.
-- Each set begins with a positive integer which specifies the number
--   of integers within the set.
-- Each set is made up of one, two, or three distinct numbers.
-- Output consists of statistics on the set(s) of numbers including
--    the set number, the distinct numbers, the frequency of each
--    number, the percentage of each number, and the number that
--    appears the most frequently accompanied by the dataset in
--    which it appears.
-- Input is assumed to be valid.
-- Sample input:
--   3
--   49 45 49
-- Corresponding output:
--   Dataset:  1
--   Number 1:     49     2    66.7%
--   Number 2:     45     1    33.3%
--   Total:               3

--   Most frequent: 49
--   From dataset: 1
